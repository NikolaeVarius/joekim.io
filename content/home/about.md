I am an Engineer who is naturally curious about how things work.I became interested in programming in College and started to try and use it to automate as many things in my life as possible.

Fast foward to now, I am studying to bridge the DevOps and Data Science gap using large scale automation tools combined with understanding how to sort, aggregate, and analyze data.

I enjoy figuring out how things work and how to make them more efficient. Paradoxically, I also enjoy making things as needlessly complex as possible for no purpose other than to do it.

I've worked with a variety of technologies in work and out. This includes platforms such as AWS as well as technolgies like Docker and Ansible.
